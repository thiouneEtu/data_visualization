## Data visualization framework
Development of a data visualization framework as part of the practical application of the knowledge acquired in the course of no-traditional database, Master (first year) Computer Science at University of Caen Normandy.

## Technologies used
1) Docker
3) Mongo DB
4) GraphQL
5) D3.js

## Commands to run the project
- cd graphql
- rm -en node_modules/
- docker build -t graphql .
- cd .
- docker-compose -f stack.yml up -d

## Access the application
localhost:8080

## Access Mongo Express
localhost:8081

## Results

## Conclusion
In short, this project allowed us to approach in depth the different notions learned in class and to put them into practice in an application project. It also allowed us to understand how Docker works and how applications can be deployed much more easily while avoiding a lot of conflicts related to compatibility problems at the system level.
